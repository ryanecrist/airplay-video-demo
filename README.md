# AirPlay Video Demo

Experimenting with Apple's new [`AVSampleBufferVideoRenderer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebuffervideorenderer) API (released iOS 17) to see if it offers similar AirPlay support to its audio counterpart, [`AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avsamplebufferaudiorenderer).

Unfortunately at this time it (still) doesn't appear possible to achieve this.
